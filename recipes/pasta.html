        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a meaty treaty carby fun time.</p>
        <p>This is my favourite meal that I can make myself. My <strong><em>actual</em></strong> favourite meal 
            is still this meal, but made by my dad. I guess the proportions are better in his version?</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 million grams of dry spaghetti pasta</li>
            <li>1 massive pack of beef mince</li>
            <li>1 whole chorizo. Even if it's a huge one, just what it all in</li>
            <li>1 whole pack of smoked bacon. See above for 'what if it's a huge pack tho?'</li>
            <li>2 tins chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 box/jar/tin/serving of passata</li>
            <li>Absolutely loads of garlic. Honestly</li>
            <li>Some worcester sauce</li>
            <li>Olive oil for the pan (still quite a bit though)</li>
            <li>Half a jar of Italian seasoning (or oregano if you don't have that)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up the oil in a big pan.</li>
            <li>No - a bigger pan. Did you not see the ingredients??</li>
            <li>Chop up the bacon and chorizo into whatever size you want them</li>
            <li>Add all your meat to the pan, and fry until the mince is brown and the chorizo makes everything orange</li>
            <li>Add garlic and fry for another 4-6 mins</li>
            <li>Add everything else, and then cook on medium for anywhere between 10-40 mins</li>
            <li>15 mins before the end, boil the kettle and make however much spaghetti you think you want</li>
            <li>...Interesting! I would have gone with more. Oh well.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, and serve with dollops of meaty treaty sauce</li>
        </ol>
