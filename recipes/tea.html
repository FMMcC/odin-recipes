        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly spent far too long on listing ingredients for other recipes, I've picked this one because it's mich shorter!
        </p>
        <p>That said, I also really love a strong cuppa so it's nice to get that out there</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A teabag</li>
            <li>Boiling water</li>
            <li>A dash of milk (or more, if you're not making it for me)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill the kettle with enough water for your size of cup/mug, and set to boil</li>
            <li>Pop a teabag in your cup</li>
            <li>Pour your boiling water into the cup until it's almost full</li>
            <li>Leave to brew for 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the teabag, and add a dash of milk (or, if not making it for me, to taste)</li>
        </ol>
