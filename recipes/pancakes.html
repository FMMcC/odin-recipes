        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe makes up to 3 fluffy american pancakes, with a fruity cinnamon 
                twist. Cobbled together from many different recipes found on the internet.</p>
            <p>It's my favourite type of pancake, but my partner prefers crepes - sigh.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>135g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking power (or bicarb, whatever is in the cupboard)</li>
            <li>Half tsp salt
            <li>2 tbs sugar (preferably brown but I've found anything works)</li>
            <li>1 tbs cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp mixed spice</li>
            <li><em>So</em> many sultanas 
                (I've never measured them, it's like a layer on the top of the mixture though)</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>130ml milk</li>
            <li>2 tbs oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sift</strong> and combine the dry ingredients in a bowl</li>
            <li>In another bowl, gently beat the egg</li>
            <li>Add milk to the egg and whisk</li>
            <li>Add oil and vanilla to the egg mix, and whisk again</li>
            <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry, stirring as you go</li>
            <li>Once everything is mixed together, spoon a great big dollop onto a hot frying pan and fry for 7 mins, turning once halfway</li>
            <li>Either serve immediately or wrap in a tea towel sandwiched between plates to keep warm</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 6-7 until you run out of batter</li>
        </ol>
