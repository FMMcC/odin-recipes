# odin-recipes
Odin Foundations Project: Recipes
This project is to create a website with an index (homepage) with links to other pages of recipes.
By the end of this project I will have demonstrated skills in:
 - html (inc. boilerplate, tags, links, and style conventions);
 - file structure and naming;
 - git (inc. clone, add, commit, push, log, good commit messages)
 - GitHub
